## Long Version
Throughout the Philippine Islands, the 100mm x 125mm parcel of the intermediate pad or most commonly known as a "one-fourth" sheet of paper is used extensively in practically most school activities, most evidently in group collaborations or projects.

In a nation where the common student could not afford to use a smartphone in class, it is imperative that the school and faculty must consistently deliver quality education using their resources, without compromising the delicate situation our world is facing with its environment.

Thus, an app that could transfrom the manual nature of grouping students in a class into an automated function within a mobile app would benefit:
- the student by **reducing the need of buying new school supplies and to throw paper waste**,
- the teachers by **simplfying the task of grouping and grading students**,
- and the local community by **producing students engaged in modern methods of teaching and technology literacy**.
